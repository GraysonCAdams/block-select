Enhance your Obsidian writing experience with smart text selection. This plugin adds clickable text icons beside headers that intelligently select all content under that header until the next header of the same level.

## ‚ú® Features

### ÔøΩ Smart Header-Based Text Selection

- **Intelligent Block Detection**: Automatically detects content blocks under headers
- **Visual Text Icons**: Lucide text icons appear beside headers when cursor is nearby
- **One-Click Selection**: Click the icon to select all content until the next header of the same level
- **Smart Cursor Detection**: Icons appear when cursor is on the header or in its content block

### ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Selection Options

- **Customizable Icons**: Choose from 1,000+ Lucide icons with searchable grid picker
- **Header Inclusion Toggle**: Choose whether to include the header in the selection (defaults to text-only)
- **Command Integration**: Optionally run any Obsidian command after text selection
- **Auto-Copy to Clipboard**: Automatically copy selected text with a confirmation toast notification
- **Tooltip Guidance**: Hover tooltips clearly explain the selection behavior

### ÔøΩ Precise Content Targeting

- **Level-Aware Selection**: Respects header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- **Block Boundaries**: Stops selection at the next header of the same or higher level
- **Clean Selection**: Selects complete paragraphs and content blocks without artifacts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Plugin Settings

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to **Community Plugins** ‚Üí **Block Select**
3. Configure your preferences:
   - **Include Header in Selection**: Toggle whether the header itself is included when selecting (defaults to false)
   - **Run Command After Selection**: Optionally choose an Obsidian command to execute after each text selection

## üìñ Usage

### Selecting Text Blocks

1. **Navigate to a Header**: Place your cursor on any header (H1, H2, H3, etc.) or in the content block beneath it
2. **See the Text Icon**: A text selection icon will appear beside the header
3. **Click to Select**: Click the icon to select all content from after the header until the next header of the same level
4. **Optional Command**: If configured, your chosen Obsidian command will run automatically after selection

### Icon Behavior

- **Visibility**: The text icon appears when:
  - Your cursor is positioned on a header line
  - Your cursor is anywhere in the content block under that header
- **Selection Range**: The selection includes:
  - All paragraphs, lists, and content after the header
  - Stops at the next header of the same or higher level
  - Optionally includes the header itself (if enabled in settings)

### Example Selection

```markdown
## My Header [üìÑ] <- Icon appears here

This paragraph will be selected.

So will this one.

- And this list item
- And this one too

### Sub-header (not selected)

This content belongs to the sub-header.

## Next Header <- Selection stops here
```

### Tooltip Help

- Hover over any text selection icon to see: **"Select text under this header"**
- The cursor changes to a pointer when hovering over clickable icons

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Icons Not Appearing

1. Make sure the plugin is enabled in Community Plugins
2. Check that you're in a Markdown file (`.md` extension)
3. Ensure your cursor is on a header line or in content below a header
4. Try switching to a different pane and back to refresh the view

### Selection Issues

1. **Selection seems wrong**: Headers must follow Markdown syntax (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
2. **Nothing selected**: Make sure there's content between the header and the next header of the same level
3. **Too much selected**: Check for proper header hierarchy - the plugin stops at same or higher level headers

### Performance

- **Large documents**: The plugin efficiently detects headers without performance impact
- **Many headers**: Icons only appear for the currently relevant header near your cursor
- **Real-time updates**: Icon visibility updates immediately as you move your cursor

### Commands Not Running

1. Verify the command is available in your Obsidian installation
2. Check that the command can run with the current selection
3. Some commands may require specific contexts or selected content types

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All text analysis and header detection happens locally on your device
- **No Data Transmission**: Plugin doesn't send any data to external servers
- **No Data Collection**: Plugin doesn't collect or store usage analytics
- **Settings Storage**: Settings are stored locally in Obsidian's data directory
- **Minimal Permissions**: Plugin only needs access to editor content for text selection
